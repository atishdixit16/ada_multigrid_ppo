## Code Repository: Simulation-Based Robust Optimal Control with an Adaptive Multi-Grid Reinforcement Learning Framework

Welcome to the code repository associated with the paper titled:

- **Title**: Simulation-based robust optimal control using an adaptive multi-grid reinforcement learning framework
- **Authors**: Atish Dixit, Ahmed H. ElSheikh
- **Affiliation**: School of Energy, Geoscience, Infrastructure, and Society, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK
- **Journal**: Mathematical Geosciences
- **DOI**: [10.1007/s11004-022-10033-x](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11004-022-10033-x)

This repository houses the simulations and result visualizations for two distinct case studies. These case studies are elaborated upon and showcased within Jupyter notebooks available in the respective folders:

- `case 1`
- `case 2`

Should there be any accessibility issues with certain notebooks on GitHub, we provide an alternative link for your convenience: [Notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/atishdixit16/ada_multigrid_ppo/tree/main/)

Feel free to explore and engage with these resources to gain insights into the realm of simulation-based robust optimal control through the lens of the adaptive multi-grid reinforcement learning framework.
